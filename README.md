This project aims to predict customer churn in the fashion retail industry using various machine learning techniques. The study focuses on the European Union market and employs Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest models. The project involves feature selection using SelectKBest, handling class imbalance with SMOTE, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases my ability to perform the following skills:

* Data Preprocessing: Proficiency in cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.

* Feature Selection: Expertise in selecting relevant features to improve model performance.

* Handling Class Imbalance: Ability to use techniques like SMOTE to address class imbalance issues.

* Model Building: Experience in constructing and training machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.

*  Hyperparameter Tuning: Competence in optimizing model parameters using GridSearchCV.

* Model Evaluation: Skill in assessing model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and confusion matrix.

* Python Programming: Proficiency in Python and its libraries, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

* Machine Learning: Understanding and application of different machine learning techniques and algorithms.

* Analytical Thinking: Ability to analyze results and draw meaningful conclusions to inform future research and applications.

The study revealed that the Random Forest model consistently outperformed Logistic Regression and SVM across various experiments. This was attributed to its ability to effectively utilize selected features and handle imbalanced data, yielding higher accuracy and AUC scores. Logistic Regression and SVM also showed competitive performance, particularly when augmented with SMOTE for balancing class distribution.
